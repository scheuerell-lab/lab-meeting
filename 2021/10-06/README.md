* There is a new Title IX training requirement; here are some details:

> Effective October 1, 2021, the University is implementing a mandatory online Title IX course for all employees—including faculty, trainees and other academic personnel, and staff —as well as students. The below email went out to all UW employees announcing the new training requirement. Under the timeline below, the training will roll out first to new employees and students, although existing employees can complete the required course now. 
>
> The goal of the training is to help employees and students create equitable environments within our UW community--free of sex- and gender-based violence, harassment, and discrimination. The course takes approximately 60-90 minutes to complete, and it can be completed over multiple sessions.
> 
> The UW has established a central tracking database to confirm completion of the training. As the tracking database has limited access rights (only 3 people per school/college/unit), we will be accessing the database and will develop reports to share with supervisors.  Each supervisor will be responsible for ensuring completion for employees as the training is rolled out. For now, we ask that you incorporate communicating the training requirement into any new employee onboarding process as soon as possible and allow new employees time to complete the course.
> 
> Planned Rollout Timeline:  
> • New employees with a hire date of October 1, 2021, or later will receive an automated email with a link to the course. They must complete the course within 30 days.  
> • Existing employees must complete the course, too. The formal roll out to existing employees will begin in winter quarter, although existing employees can access and take the training now.  
> • New students will receive an email mid-October with a link to the course instructing them to complete the course prior to the end of fall quarter. Similar messaging will go out to new students in winter and spring quarters.  
> • Student employees may access the student course and the employee course. Students new to UW for fall 2021 who are hired as student employees after October 1 will be required to complete the student and employee courses. In future quarters, an abbreviated student employee track will be available to new students who have already completed the new student course.  
> • Continuing students will be able to complete the course in mid-October. Student organizations, programs, or units who want to require the course of their student members should coordinate in advance with the Office of the Title IX Coordinator.
> 
> Please note there are four tailored course tracks for employees, each with different content based on the employee’s role:
> 
> • faculty and other academic personnel
> 
> • staff
> 
> • clinical healthcare
> 
> • student employee
> 
> Within the course tracks there are also opportunities to further customize by selecting to review particular scenarios. Employees may access the course here: https://tixemployee.uw.edu/
> 
> More information about Title IX and the course can be found at Title IX education & prevention here: https://www.washington.edu/titleix/title-ix-education-and-outreach/
