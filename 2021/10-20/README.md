> On October 27, from 1–2pm, we will have a virtual meeting with WKC, during which the consultants will present their findings and recommendations and will answer questions from the SAFS community. I am including the Zoom information below; please add this to your calendars. We know this time won't work for everyone, so we will be collecting questions in advance and share notes from the presentation. I'll also be setting up some times for folks to talk after the presentation (stay tuned).
