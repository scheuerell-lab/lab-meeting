* Back to school/work -- email from Andre:

> I hope this email finds you safe and well (and staying as cool as possible).  We are excited to start planning to bring employees back to campus, consistent with public health guidance, with the goal of having full onsite operations by September 13, 2021, in time for fall quarter. Fall may seem like a long time off, but we are sending this message as far in advance as possible to give you time to plan and so that we can support your successful return to onsite work.
>
> Though we don’t know what the public health guidance will be in September, please know that the safety of our students, faculty and staff is our highest priority. The University has developed and implemented [robust safety guidance and protocols](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/covid-19-health-and-safety-resources) that all employees are expected to review and follow.
>
> Understanding and complying with safety procedures is a shared responsibility. In order to ensure we can be together safely, each of you will be required to:
>
> - Participate in a one-time safety training -- All employees will receive [training on the University’s COVID-19 Prevention Plan](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/covid-19-safety-training-back-workplace) and our unit’s safety plan.
>
> - [Complete a daily attestation](https://hr.uw.edu/coronavirus/return-to-on-site-work/covid-19-employee-symptom-attestation/) – All employees must complete a daily attestation each day they work onsite regardless of vaccination status.
>
> - Vaccinate against COVID-19 – All employees are [required to be vaccinated against COVID-19](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/2021/06/03/requiring-vaccinations-for-uw-employees-to-protect-our-community/) by autumn quarter in order to work onsite. Employees may be exempted for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons.
>
> Employees who have concerns regarding their ability to return to onsite work or wish to request a hybrid or remote work arrangement please complete the following by August 31, 2021:
>
> - Request a hybrid work arrangement (partial week telework, partial week onsite) with your manager/supervisor.
>
> - Review information regarding Telework Policy and Procedures, including forms are located on the [SAFS Intranet Sharepoint site](https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/sites/safs/SAFS%20Policies%20%20Procedures%20AZ/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=114fe4c3%2D8b0f%2D4762%2D8f60%2Dc7fc95faa6f2&id=%2Fsites%2Fsafs%2FSAFS%20Policies%20%20Procedures%20AZ%2FHR).
>
> - Review the Disability Services Office (DSO) if you anticipate you will need a disability accommodation to remain working fully remote.
>
> We are looking forward to enjoying the increased collaboration, communication, and celebration of having everyone back together.
